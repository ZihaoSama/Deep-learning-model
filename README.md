# Deep-learning-model
This project is to train a deep learning image processing model that can classify through image sets of cherries, strawberries, and tomatoes.
The goal is that when given a picture, the model can tell whether it is a picture of a cherry, a strawberry, or a tomato. The focus of this project is to build a CNN model and improve
the accuracy of the model through tuning. In this project, I successfully built a CNN
model and continuously tuned and trained it. First, I build a neural network (MLP) to classify images. It is then updated to a CNN model
for prediction, using some CNN methods to improve accuracy. I mainly improve
accuracy by modifying the loss function and optimizer, and use pre-trained models to
improve model performance.
I trained and optimized my model in jupyter notebook and finally generated the model.
